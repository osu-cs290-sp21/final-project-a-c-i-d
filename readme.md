# Foo Flight :bird:

A web platform game with bird sprites and levels to beat!

## CS290 Final Project

We created this project with an ambitious idea for a fun game that Rob Hess could play in mind. This project exists due to the hard work and creativity of all our contributors.

## How to Install and Use

Dev Mode:
1. Create a local copy of this repo on your machine.
2. You may have to `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` if you haven't before.
3. In your command line or terminal, `cd client`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Now the game should be loaded at localhost/9000
6. Party! ðŸ¥³
